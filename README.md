# Flask webserver for my personal website

No one will need to run this, I don't even need these notes... But in the name of documentation here is how to start up the webserver

### Running locally
```
# navigate to the root directory
cd coredumped.info

# create virtualenv and activate it
python -m venv venv && source ./venv/bin/activate

# install deps
pip install -r ./requirements.txt

# run this command in the `coredumped` directory
flask run
```
