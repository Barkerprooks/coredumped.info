# SNMP - Simple Network Manager Protocol
An Internet Standard for managing network devices

## Protocol Details
`SNMP` is used by a network controlling device (often a router or central server) to manage and monitor devices on the network.

they call the servers `managers` and the clients `agents`.

there are also concepts such as `traps` and `polling`. It seems like this is how `SNMP` communicates certain information to networked machines. This is how it is able to provide real-time updates for devices.

The data is stored in tree-like structures. 

The data is stored on the `manager` machine.
