# Day 1: hello world

If you've somehow gotten to this page today, hello! 

Everything looks terrible right now. I admit. I do have at least one post up right now though. If you're interested in learning about offensive security concepts, I have a walkthrough of one of the [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.com) machines right [here](/blog/ctfs/htb/underpass). I want to keep writing these and releasing them. Not only do they help me, but I also get to teach another skid who's too shy to ask for help.

Whelp, perhaps this post will stay up... who knows. No one knows about this website so I'm being more loose with everything for the moment.

By the way, everything looks like SHIT right now. Please be patient while I remedy this.
