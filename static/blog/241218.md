# Advent of Code 2024 - A Programming Language A Day Does _Not_ Keep The Doctor Away
#####  _published_: 12/18/24, _updated_: 12/20/24
## 25 Days of Programming Languages
This is going to be my big ol article about learning a new language for each challenge.
Not super worried about quality right now, who tf is reading this?
### Day 1: C++
`C++` isn't __ever__ my first choice for anything, nor is it my second, or third. In fact, 
I have a seemingly illogical distaste for the language despite my endless love for `C`. 
That's why I decided to get it out of the way for the first challenge. It's a nice enough
language don't get me wrong, It's just not interesting to me. 

The problem statement here was basically asking for us to compare two lists. We need to 
take the smallest number of each list, pair them up, find the difference between the two 
numbers, then add that number to a running total, moving on to the next smallest number 
and so on. all the way until you reach the final two numbers. For example, consider the 
following pair of lists:

    3   4
    4   3
    2   5
    1   3
    3   9
    3   3

This list generates the value `11` after finding the differences `2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5`. 

#### Part 1
To start this off, we should at least generate a collection of both lists that can be 
sorted, since we just need to pair up the smallest one and go on to the next smallest 
until the end. Its describing a sorted set. 

Lets use a `std::vector`

    :::c++
    std::vector<int> ls, rs; // left side list and right side list

A vector in `C++` is a dynamic array. We can generate our lists using `C++` file streams
in a fairly succinct way like so:

    :::c++
    bool leftSide = true; // switch to toggle which token gets added to which list
    int token;

    std::fstream file("./day/1/input.txt"); // open a handle to the input
    while (file >> token) {
        leftSide ? ls.push_back(token) : rs.push_back(token);
        leftSide = !leftSide; // toggle left/right on each value
    }
    file.close(); // don't need this anymore

In `C++` the `std::sort` function operates by manipulating the data structure in-place 
(from our perspective). We can sort the left and right lists by passing their
iterator pointers like so:

    :::c++
    // sort the vectors in-place (problem says we need to compare them sorted)
    std::sort(ls.begin(), ls.end());
    std::sort(rs.begin(), rs.end());

I'm sure there's a more effective way to create a summation, however this is how I added
all the differences together:

    :::c++
    // a simple for loop. the problem states we only need the distance between each. 
    // abs() will give us the actual distance if one is larger.
    int part1 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < ls.size(); i++)
        part1 += abs(ls[i] - rs[i]); 

And there we go. Part 1 of day 1 is complete. We plug our solution in, get our star, and
move on to the part 2 of this challenge.

    :::c++
    std::cout << "part 1: " << part1 << std::endl; // we can print integers with streams

#### Part 2
The second part of an AoC day is usually a more challenging take on the initial challenge.
Most of the time you can use a lot of your previous solution, only modified slightly. 

This part of the challenge asks us to "Calculate a total similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list." So lets do that.

For this we can use a hash table. A basic in hash table in `C++` is a `std::map`.

    :::c++
    std::map<int, int> counts; // table of values and how many times they appear

We will leverage the for loop from earlier. Just add this operation before calculating
part 1

    :::c++
    for (i = 0; i < ls.size(); i++) {
        // build a map of right side values and how many times each value appears for part 2
        if (counts.count(rs[i]) == 0)
            counts[rs[i]] = 1;
        else
            counts[rs[i]]++;

        part1 += abs(ls[i] - rs[i]); 
    }

Now that we have our counts, we can calculate part 2. Again, there is probably a better
way to do this, but I have just done it implicitly. 

    :::c++
    for (i = 0; i < ls.size(); i++) {
        if (counts.count(ls[i]))
            part2 += ls[i] * counts[ls[i]]; 
    }

And thats that!

    :::c++
    std::cout << "part 2: " << part2 << std::endl;

For 2 stars on day 1. That wasnt so bad. I was hungry for more after this, but perhaps my
eyes were too big for my stomach...
