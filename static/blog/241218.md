## 25 Days of Programming Languages
### Day 1: C++
`C++` isn't __ever__ my first choice for anything, nor is it my second, or third. In fact, 
I have a seemingly illogical distaste for the language, despite my endless love for `C`. 
That's why I decided to get it out of the way. 

The problem statement here was basically asking for us to compare two lists. We need to 
take the smallest number of each list, pair them up, find the difference between the two 
numbers, then add that number to a running total, moving on to the next smallest number 
and so on. all the way until you reach the final two numbers. For example, consider the following list:

    3   4
    4   3
    2   5
    1   3
    3   9
    3   3

This list generates the value `11` after finding the differences `2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5`. 

To start this off, we should at least generate a collection of both lists that can be 
sorted, since we just need to pair up the smallest one and go on to the next smallest 
until the end. Its describing a sorted set. 

Lets use a vector:

    :::c++
    std::vector<int> ls, rs; // left side list and right side list

A vector in `C++` is a dynamic array. We can generate our lists using `C++` file streams
in a fairly succinct way like so:

    :::c++
    bool leftSide = true; // switch to toggle which token gets added to which list
    int i, token;

    std::fstream file("./day/1/input.txt"); // open a handle to the input
    while (file >> token) {
        leftSide ? ls.push_back(token) : rs.push_back(token);
        leftSide = !leftSide; // toggle left/right on each value
    }
    file.close(); // don't need this anymore

In `C++` the `std::sort` function operates by manipulating the data structure in-place 
(from our perspective). We can sort the left and right lists by passing their
iterator pointers like so:

    :::c++
    // sort the vectors in-place (problem says we need to compare them sorted)
    std::sort(ls.begin(), ls.end());
    std::sort(rs.begin(), rs.end());

I'm sure there's a more effective way to create a summation, however this is how I added
all the differences together:

    :::c++
    int part1 = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < ls.size(); i++)
        part1 += abs(ls[i] - rs[i]);
